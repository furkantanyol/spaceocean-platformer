# Phaser 3 + React + TypeScript - Old School Platformer Game

![phaser-3-react](https://storage.googleapis.com/spaceocean/phaser-react.png)

Phaser 3 is the latest version of one of the best game development libraries written in JavaScript that allows implementing your ideas into actual game form easily.

## Motivation

When I first wanted to explore game development using JavaScript I came across [MDN's Phaser 2 tutorial](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/en/guides/platformer/start-here/) and really liked the old school platformer game. I also like using React and thought it would be cool and convenient to create a Phaser game along with using React and it's components.
Then, I realized Phaser has a new version [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) which has a lot of improvements on v2. However, the new version was not backwards compatible, there were some differences in code.
With this repo, I wanted to help you out with these differences and implement the same cool old school platformer game in Phaser 3. What I’ve gotten working is a very rough example to show how things might work together!

In this example I won’t go over every line of code, but rather concentrate on the important parts which make everything run together. You can check out the repo here. I’m using Phaser 3, React 16 (create-react-app v2 with Typescript) and Redux to connect everything together.
